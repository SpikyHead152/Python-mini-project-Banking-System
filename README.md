# Python-mini-project-Banking-System

## Project Overview
This mini project is a simple **Banking System** built using **Python** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It demonstrates how classes and objects can be used to simulate real-world banking operations such as account management, transactions, and reports.

---

## Objective
To develop a banking system that can:
- Create and manage customer accounts  
- Allow deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers  
- Prevent invalid actions like overdrafts or negative deposits  
- Maintain transaction history for each account  
- Generate account and bank summaries or reports  

---

## Key Concepts Used
- **Classes and Objects (OOP)**
- **Encapsulation & Abstraction**
- **Exception Handling**
- **File Handling (for reports and data)**
- **Modular Programming** using multiple `.py` files
